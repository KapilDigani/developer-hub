Harness integrates with many different types of repositories and providers. We call connections to cloud platforms **Cloud Providers** and connections to other platforms **Connectors**.

**Cloud Providers** connect to your deployment environments, such as Kubernetes Clusters, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Physical Data Centers.

**Connectors** help you pull in artifacts, sync with repos, integrate verification and analytics tools, and leverage collaboration channels.

The following topics describe each of the Harness integrations you can make:

* [Add Cloud Providers](/article/whwnovprrb-cloud-providers)
* [Add Artifact Servers](/article/7dghbx1dbl-configuring-artifact-server)
* [Add Source Repo Providers](/article/ay9hlwbgwa-add-source-repo-providers)
* [Add Collaboration Providers](/article/cv98scx8pj-collaboration-providers)
* [Add Verification Providers](/article/r6ut6tldy0-verification-providers)
