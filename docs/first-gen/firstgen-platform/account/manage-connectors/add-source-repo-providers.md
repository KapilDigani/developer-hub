Harness Source Repo Providers connect your Harness account with your Git platform accounts to synchronize your Harness account and Applications and pull important files, such as Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, and Terraform scripts.

### Connect to Your Repo

* [Add a GitHub Repo](/article/sip9rr6ogy-add-github-repo)
* [Add a Bitbucket Repo](/article/etl0yejzsm-add-bitbucket-repo)
* [Add a GitLab Repo](/article/od1u7t4vgq-add-a-gitlab-repo)
* [Add a CodeCommit Repo](/article/o6w4vvzgdg-add-a-code-commit-repo)
* [Add an Azure DevOps Repo](/article/k89ioqv8fw-add-an-azure-dev-ops-repo)

CodeCommit is supported as a Source Repo only. It cannot be used with [Harness Git Sync](/article/htvzryeqjw-configuration-as-code).Ensure your Git repo is initialized (`git init`) before connecting Harness to it.### See Also
