For Harness to verify the success of your deployments and services, you must connect Harness to your verification providers, as outlined in this topic:

* [Before You Begin](#before_you_begin)
* [Step 1: Connect a Verification Provider](#step_1_connect_a_verification_provider)
* [Step 2: Configure Your Verification Provider](#configure)
* [Option: Custom Metrics and Logs](#custom)

Harness will use your tools to verify deployments, and will use Harness' machine learning features to identify sources of failures.
